<b>Play Intructions:</b>

To run the game from the Unity Editor you must launch from the Intro scene found in the Scenes folder under GUIScenes.
Note that it is safe to run the game directly from the BetterGreybox scene, however not all functionality may be present.

To run the game without the editor, simply use the Alpha_Final Executable to run the game.

<b>In-Game Intructions:</b>

The options menu can be found upon starting the game. Options include Inverting the Camera's Y-axis and
toggling a slide option on the player character.

While in game you can press x+c to toggle between the two camera types (A free-cam and smart-cam).

<b>Alpha Intructions:</b>
NOTE: The Alpha submission build can be found on the Alpha_Final Branch.
